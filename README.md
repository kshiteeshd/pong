A classic **two-player Pong game** built from scratch using **Java Swing**.
This project recreates the original arcade gameplay with smooth physics, sound effects, scoring system, and a complete menu interface.

The game was developed as a learning project to understand **game loops, collision physics, rendering, and input handling in Java**.
